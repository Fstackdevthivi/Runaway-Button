# Runaway-Button
Runaway Button is a fun and interactive project that features a button on a web page that tries to escape when the user's mouse gets too close. Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates how to manipulate DOM elements dynamically in response to mouse movements, making the button "run away" when the user tries to click it.
